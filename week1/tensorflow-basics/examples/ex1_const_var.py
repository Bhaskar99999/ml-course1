# Example 1: feed_dict with placeholder
# create a placeholder of type float 32-bit, value is a vector of 3 elements
a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[3])

# create a constant of type float 32-bit, value is a vector of 3 elements

# use the placeholder as you would a constant
c = a + b  # short for tf.add(a, b)

with tf.Session() as sess:
	#print(sess.run(c)) # error because a doesnâ€™t have any value

	# feed [1, 2, 3] to placeholder a via the dict {a: [1, 2, 3]}
	# fetch value of c
	print(sess.run(c, {a: [1, 2, 3]})) # >> [6. 7. 8.]
